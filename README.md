RcppMLPACK2: GSOC 2019 (Easy Test + Hard Test)

mlpack is a scalable machine learning library, written in C++, that aims to provide fast, extensible implementations of cutting-edge machine learning algorithms. mlpack provides these algorithms as simple command-line programs and C++ classes which can then be integrated into larger-scale machine learning solutions.
